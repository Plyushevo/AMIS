# Welcome to Python lesson 0! It's called lesson 0, since the numbers in Python start from 0.
# Here are tasks for you. By doing these, you should be able to get up to pace with Python
# We'll start with the very basics, and will go progressively further
# I will add keywords at many points during these lessons
# The keywords can be searched for on the internet, and hint at what can be used to solve the tasks
# Just type your answer after the task description and run the code from this document. Or if you want, you can write them in a separate document.

# Keywords: print, string, hello world, variable, value, input, operators, assignments
# Type conversion

# 1 Hello World!
# Print Hello World! to the console.



# 2 Basic variables

# Create 2 variables, "name" which is a string and contains your name
# "age" which contains your age
# Print them in a sentence such as: "My name is name and I am age years old."



# 3 Simple Math
# Declare 2 integer variables "a" and "b". Assign them values.
# Print the result of a + b, a - b, a * b and a / b.



# 4 User Input
# Use input() to get the user's name and age. Print a greeting using these values.



# 5 String manipulation
# Create a string variable with the value "Python is fun!"
# Print this string in uppercase and lowercase
# You can use the methods upper() and lower()



# 6 Type conversion (str to int)
# Ask the user to input a number. Multiply this number by 2 and print the result
# You can take the input like this: number = int(input("Enter a number"))



# 7 Conditionals (if-elif-else)
# Assign a number to the variable x
# Write a program that checks if the value of x is greater than 10. Otherwise, print 10 or less.



# 8 len() function
# Ask the user to input their full name. Print the length of their name (number of characters)
